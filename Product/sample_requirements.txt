# RadarScene Project Requirements

## 1. Overview
- Project Name: RadarScene
- Project Description: This application allows a User to setup a "scene". A "scene" is an automatically generated collection points of interests for a hyper-niche interest.

- Target Users: People looking to be extremely clued-in to hyper-local hyper niche scenes.
- Key Goals: 
  - Create a platform that connects users with their niche interests in their local area
  - Provide personalized, curated content based on specific interests and location
  - Automate the discovery process for niche scenes
  - Build community around shared micro-interests
  - Deliver a daily AI-generated blog tailored to each user's unique interests and local area
